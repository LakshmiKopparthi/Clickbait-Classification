\title{CLICKBAIT CLASSIFICATION}
\maketitle

 Clickbait classification is an essential task in the digital media landscape, focused on identifying and differentiating between sensationalized, misleading headlines and authentic, informative ones. This distinction is vital for maintaining the integrity of information and ensuring that readers are not misled by exaggerated or deceptive content. The proliferation of clickbait not only diminishes the quality of information but also undermines the trust between media platforms and their audiences. Effective clickbait classification can help mitigate these issues, promoting a more reliable and trustworthy online environment.

The proposed project aims to advance the current state of clickbait classification by developing a robust system capable of accurately discerning clickbait from genuine headlines. This system will be designed to handle the complexities and subtleties of natural language, ensuring a high level of precision in classification. By integrating various features and metrics, the project seeks to create a comprehensive solution that can be easily deployed and scaled. The ultimate goal is to provide a tool that enhances the quality of online content, supports content curators, and improves user experience by reducing the prevalence of misleading headlines.
